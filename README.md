# fourierSeries

In mathematics, a Fourier serie is a way to represent a function as the sum of simple sine waves. More formally, it decomposes any periodic function or periodic signal into the weighted sum of a (possibly infinite) set of simple oscillating functions, namely sines and cosines [Wikipedia]

In the link bellow you can find the Visualization of the Fourier series https://cardonajd.github.io/fourierSeries/. In the bottom left corner you will find a bar wich allowes you to increse upper bound of the sumatory of the Fourier Serie.
